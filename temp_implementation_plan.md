## üéØ Sprint Strategy

### Sprint Structure
- **Monday**: Planning & Architecture Review
- **Tuesday-Thursday**: Core Development
- **Friday**: Integration & Testing Focus

### Parallelization Opportunities
- Backend and frontend development can run in parallel after Sprint 3
- LLM integration can be developed alongside frontend components
- Testing can be integrated throughout all phases

### Dependencies & Critical Path
- Canonical resolution must complete before validation
- Validation must complete before scoring engines
- Integration testing requires full stack
- Performance optimization needs end-to-end testing

---

## üß™ **Value-First Testing Strategy**

### **Testing Philosophy**
We test for **business value**, not for testing's sake. Every test must prevent user pain or catch business-critical bugs.

### **Test Pyramid Distribution**
- **Unit Tests (70%)**: Business logic, data processing, validation
- **Integration Tests (25%)**: API contracts, service boundaries
- **E2E Tests (5%)**: Critical user journeys only

### **Sprint Testing Milestones**

#### **Sprints 1-3: Foundation Testing**
**Focus**: Core business logic and critical user workflows

**Backend (Cursor):**
```bash
# High-value tests only
pytest tests/unit/ -v --tb=short
mypy core/ --strict
ruff check core/ --fix
```

**Frontend (Lovable.dev):**
```bash
# Business-critical components only
npm run test:unit -- --coverage
npm run lint -- --fix
npm run type-check
```

**Success Criteria:**
- Critical path coverage ‚â•60%
- Zero linting errors, zero type errors
- All high-value tests passing in CI/CD

#### **Sprints 4-6: Integration Testing**
**Focus**: API contracts and service boundaries

**API Integration:**
```bash
# Test API endpoints with real data flow
pytest tests/integration/ -v
```

**Frontend Integration:**
```bash
# Test service layer integration
npm run test:integration
```

**Success Criteria:**
- All public APIs tested with valid/invalid inputs
- Service boundaries validated
- Data flow integrity confirmed

#### **Sprints 7-9: E2E Testing**
**Focus**: Critical user journeys only

**E2E Testing:**
```bash
# Critical user workflows only
npm run test:e2e
```

**Success Criteria:**
- Complete analysis flow works end-to-end
- Error handling works gracefully
- Data persistence verified

#### **Sprint 10: Quality Assurance**
**Focus**: Production readiness and performance

**Performance Testing:**
```bash
# Load testing critical endpoints
k6 run tests/performance/load-test.js
```

**Security Testing:**
```bash
# Security scan
bandit -r backend/
safety check
```

**Success Criteria:**
- <30 second test execution time
- <5% bug escape rate
- Zero high-severity security issues

### **Value-First Testing Principles**
- **Business Value**: Every test must prevent user pain or catch business-critical bugs
- **Test-Alongside Development**: Write tests for new business logic, not implementation details
- **Archive Policy**: Medium-value tests archived, low-value tests deleted
- **Coverage Quality**: Focus on critical paths, not overall percentage

### **CI/CD Integration**
- **Blocking**: High-value tests, linting, type-checking, security scans
- **Warning Only**: Coverage reports, performance benchmarks
- **Excluded**: Archived tests never run in CI/CD
