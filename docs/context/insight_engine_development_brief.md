# üß† Insight Engine Development Brief

> **Last Updated**: January 27, 2025  
> **Purpose**: Single reference point for all contributors on Insight Engine development in HealthIQ AI v5

---

## üéØ Purpose

To define how we will implement HealthIQ AI's Insight Engines, pre-calculated rules, and supporting workflow (including questionnaire inputs) so that personalised health reports are delivered consistently, credibly, and in alignment with the v5 Intelligence Lifecycle.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Core Principles

### 1. **Lab Ranges First**
- Always use the user's own lab reference ranges
- Never hard-code universal ranges except for derived ratios (TG:HDL, HOMA-IR, ALT:AST, NLR, etc.)

### 2. **Deterministic Engines**
- Engines perform all calculations, thresholds, and cluster detection
- LLMs never calculate, only narrate

### 3. **Confidence Transparency**
- Stage 3.5 (Data Completeness Gate) produces a confidence score
- Score reflects marker availability and sufficiency for each engine
- Propagated through to user dashboards

---

## üß© Workflow Overview

### **Inputs**
- **Lab Panel Upload**: Lab results with ranges and values
- **Questionnaire**: Age, sex, ethnicity, lifestyle, stress, diet, exercise, alcohol, smoking, supplements, goals

### **Pipeline Stages**

| Stage | Description | Output |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **1. Parsing** | Extract biomarkers and ranges | Raw biomarker data |
| **2. Canonical Normalisation** | Map to canonical IDs, apply lab ranges | Normalized biomarker panel |
| **3. Data Completeness Gate** | Assign confidence scores | Confidence assessment |
| **4. Engine Execution** | Run Insight Engines | Structured JSON outputs |
| **5. Correlation Rules Layer** | Pre-calculated patterns from YAML rules | Pattern matches |
| **6. Insight Synthesis** | LLM receives structured outputs and narrates | Natural language insights |
| **7. Visualisation** | Dials, scores, cluster breakdowns | User interface elements |
| **8. Recommendations** | Behavioural/diet/supplement guidance | Actionable advice |

### **Engine Execution Details**
Each engine:
- Uses biomarkers + questionnaire context
- Applies deterministic rules (ratios, thresholds, correlations)
- Outputs structured JSON (score, severity, clusters, drivers, recommendations, confidence)

## üìê Insight Engines (Initial Set)

| Engine | Primary Biomarkers | Purpose |
|--------|-------------------|---------|
| **Metabolic Age Insight** | Insulin, HbA1c, TG:HDL, ALT | Biological age assessment based on metabolic biomarkers |
| **Cardiovascular Insight** | LDL/HDL, ApoB proxies, CRP, triglycerides | Cardiovascular health and risk assessment |
| **Inflammation Insight** | CRP, NLR, ferritin/albumin | Systemic inflammation and immune health evaluation |
| **Fatigue Root Cause Insight** | Iron transport, thyroid, cortisol, vitamin D, B12 | Multi-factor fatigue analysis and root cause identification |
| **Detox & Filtration Insight** | ALT, AST, GGT, eGFR, urea:creatinine | Liver and kidney detoxification capacity assessment |

### **Engine Specifications**
- **Metabolic Age Insight**: Insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), lipid ratios, metabolic stress index
- **Cardiovascular Insight**: Lipid profile assessment, diabetes risk factors, oxygen transport efficiency
- **Inflammation Insight**: CRP levels, white blood cell analysis, anemia indicators, metabolic inflammation
- **Fatigue Root Cause Insight**: Oxygen transport, energy metabolism, organ function, lifestyle factors
- **Detox & Filtration Insight**: Kidney function, liver function, lipid processing efficiency

## üß† Questionnaire Role

### **Primary Functions**

#### **1. Normalisation**
- Confirms context (age/sex ‚Üí reference ranges)
- Ensures proper biomarker interpretation

#### **2. Weighting**
- Ethnicity and lifestyle adjust severity rules in engines
- Personalizes risk assessment

#### **3. Insight Context**
- Stress, diet, alcohol, smoking, supplement use ‚Üí influences interpretation
- Provides lifestyle context for biomarker analysis

#### **4. Completeness**
- Ensures missing lab data can be partly offset with context
- Improves confidence scores when biomarkers are incomplete

### **Questionnaire Data Flow**
```
Questionnaire Responses ‚Üí Lifestyle Factors ‚Üí Engine Context ‚Üí Insight Generation
```

## üöÄ Development Plan

### **Phase 1: Foundation (Sprint 6)**
1. **Re-baseline Docs** ‚úÖ (done) ‚Äì Insight engines marked as scaffold only, design outline documented
2. **Implement Base Engine Contract** ‚Äì Registry, DTOs, auto-discovery
3. **Define Calculation Rules** ‚Äì Derived ratios, thresholds, correlation YAML

### **Phase 2: Engine Implementation (Sprint 6-7)**
4. **Build Engines Iteratively** ‚Äì Implement one engine at a time with tests
   - Start with Metabolic Age Insight (highest business value)
   - Follow with Cardiovascular Insight (critical health assessment)
   - Complete with Inflammation, Fatigue, and Detox insights

### **Phase 3: Integration (Sprint 7-8)**
5. **Integrate Questionnaire** ‚Äì Ensure context fields flow into engine execution
6. **Frontend Integration** ‚Äì Map engine outputs ‚Üí dials, confidence score, clusters, narrative

### **Implementation Priority**
- **Sprint 6**: Core modules (Metabolic Age, Heart, Inflammation)
- **Sprint 7**: Advanced modules (Fatigue, Detox) + LLM integration
- **Sprint 8**: Frontend integration and visualization

## üèóÔ∏è Architectural Rules

### **Critical Enforcement Rules**

#### **1. Lab Ranges Only**
- ‚úÖ **ALWAYS** use lab-provided reference ranges
- ‚ùå **NEVER** hard-code universal ranges
- ‚úÖ **EXCEPTION**: Derived ratios/indices defined in code (TG:HDL, HOMA-IR, ALT:AST, NLR)

#### **2. Deterministic Calculations**
- ‚úÖ **ENGINES** perform all calculations, thresholds, and cluster detection
- ‚ùå **LLMs** never calculate thresholds (only narrate)
- ‚úÖ **STRUCTURED** JSON outputs from engines

#### **3. Confidence Scoring**
- ‚úÖ **STAGE 3.5** (Data Completeness Gate) produces confidence score
- ‚úÖ **REFLECTS** marker availability and sufficiency for each engine
- ‚úÖ **PROPAGATED** through to user dashboards

#### **4. Integration Requirements**
- ‚úÖ **BaseInsight** interface implementation
- ‚úÖ **Registry** system for auto-discovery
- ‚úÖ **Orchestrator** integration for pipeline flow
- ‚úÖ **DTO** architecture for frontend consumption
