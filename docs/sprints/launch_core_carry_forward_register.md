# HealthIQ AI Launch Carry-Forward Register

## Purpose

This register captures non-blocking carry-forward items from HealthIQ AI launch, architecture, medical review, UX and regeneration sprints.

Its purpose is to prevent important follow-up work being lost between sprint chats, Cursor agents, Claude audits, or future planning sessions.

This register should be read before each new launch, architecture, medical review, narrative, regeneration or UX sprint. If a sprint resolves an item, update its status. If a sprint creates a new carry-forward, add it here.

## Status key

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Open | Still unresolved |
| In progress | Being worked on in an active sprint |
| Resolved | Completed and merged |
| Deferred | Explicitly deferred with rationale |
| Superseded | Replaced by a later decision or work item |

## Launch blocker key

| Value | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Yes | Must be resolved before launch |
| No | Can safely remain as a known post-launch or later hardening item |
| Conditional | Not a blocker now, but may become one depending on future scope |

## Carry-forward items

| ID | Source sprint | Carry-forward | Why it matters | Launch blocker? | Recommended future sprint / workstream | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CF-MEDREV2-001 | MED-REV-2 | Store original user demographics/profile context with each analysis row | Current regeneration uses the user’s current profile. If profile data changes later, strict deterministic replay may differ from the original context. | No | Result lineage / regeneration hardening | Open | Needed before claiming full historical replay determinism. |
| CF-MEDREV2-002 | MED-REV-2 | Add a formal DB lineage table for regenerated results | Current v1 lineage uses `meta.regenerated_from_analysis_id`. This is acceptable for v1, but a proper lineage table is needed for long-term auditability and multi-version result history. | No | Versioned result lineage sprint | Open | Should support parent/child result relationships and supersession history. |
| CF-MEDREV2-003 | MED-REV-2 | Clean up dead cardiovascular contributor and homocysteine bridge logic | Some older cardiovascular helper paths remain in code. They are not currently causing the card issue, but keeping them increases drift and accidental reuse risk. | No | ARCH-LEGACY cleanup | Open | Includes legacy `cv_contributor` and limited homocysteine bridge edge-case logic. |
| CF-MEDREV2-004 | MED-REV-2 | Strengthen liver confidence test assertion | The implementation works, but one test is weaker than ideal. It should strictly prove that present markers such as GGT, ALP and albumin are never described as missing. | No | Test-hardening sprint | Open | Improves regression confidence without changing product behaviour. |

## How to use this register in future sprint prompts

Add this instruction to future HealthIQ AI sprint prompts when relevant:

```text
Before implementation, read:
docs/audit-papers/launch_core_carry_forward_register.md

Do not ignore unresolved carry-forwards relevant to this work.
If this sprint resolves any item, update the register.
If this sprint creates new carry-forwards, add them to the register.
```

## Update rules

When adding a new carry-forward:

1. Use a stable ID in the format `CF-<SOURCE>-<NUMBER>`.
2. Keep the item short and specific.
3. Explain why it matters.
4. State whether it is a launch blocker.
5. Assign a likely future sprint or workstream.
6. Set status to `Open` unless the sprint has already resolved it.

When resolving an item:

1. Change status to `Resolved`.
2. Add the resolving work ID in the notes.
3. Do not delete the row unless there is a separate archival process.

## Current summary

As of MED-REV-2 closure, there are no known launch-blocking carry-forwards in this register. The open items are auditability, lineage, cleanup and test-hardening improvements.
