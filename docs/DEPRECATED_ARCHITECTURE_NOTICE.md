# ⚠️ DEPRECATED ARCHITECTURE DOCUMENTS NOTICE

## 🚨 **CRITICAL**: Do Not Use for Development Planning

The following documents are **DEPRECATED** and should **NOT** be used for sprint planning or development guidance:

### ❌ **DEPRECATED DOCUMENTS**
- `docs/synthesized technical architecture for HealthIQ-AI v5.pdf`
- `docs/synthesized technical architecture for HealthIQ-AI v5.docx`

### 📋 **Why These Are Deprecated**
1. **Outdated Implementation Status**: These documents claim many components are "MISSING" when they actually exist as scaffolded implementations
2. **Incorrect Sprint Planning**: Using these for development planning would lead to building components that already exist
3. **Misleading Architecture Assessment**: The documents don't reflect the current state of the codebase

### ✅ **CURRENT SOURCE OF TRUTH**
**Use these documents instead:**

1. **`docs/ARCHITECTURE_REVIEW_REPORT.md`** - **CURRENT ARCHITECTURE STATUS**
   - Updated to reflect actual implementation status
   - Shows what's scaffolded vs. implemented vs. missing
   - Provides accurate sprint planning guidance

2. **`docs/context/`** directory - **CANONICAL ARCHITECTURE SPECIFICATION**
   - `PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md` - Target folder structure
   - `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` - Development phases and tasks
   - `STACK_*.md` files - Technology decisions and constraints

3. **Actual Codebase** - **IMPLEMENTATION REALITY**
   - `backend/` - Current backend structure
   - `frontend/` - Current frontend structure  
   - `ops/` - Current infrastructure setup

### 🎯 **For Development Teams**

**DO NOT:**
- ❌ Use synthesized architecture documents for sprint planning
- ❌ Build components that are already scaffolded
- ❌ Reference outdated implementation status

**DO:**
- ✅ Use `ARCHITECTURE_REVIEW_REPORT.md` for current status
- ✅ Check actual codebase for existing implementations
- ✅ Focus on implementing logic in scaffolded files
- ✅ Follow `docs/context/` specifications for new components

### 📅 **Last Updated**
- **Deprecation Notice Created**: December 2024
- **Architecture Review Updated**: December 2024
- **Next Review**: After major implementation milestones

---

**This notice ensures development teams use accurate, current documentation for all architectural decisions and sprint planning.**
